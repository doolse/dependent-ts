* Based on a functional subset of Javascript - no explicit loops
* The target language will be Javascript
* The language it will be written in will be Typescript - show implementation examples in typescript
* It will have a type system which is as powerful as typescript, however:
  * I want types to be first class and manipulatable in the language
  * I don't want the types to show up at runtime unless they get explicitly re-ified
* I'd like simple type syntax for checking types at compile time - eg: const x : Int = 1
* I want to be able to make assertions that must be checked at compile time
